=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<lo2s> creates B<OTF2>-traces of uninstrumented processes and systems using the
Linux L<perf(1)> infrastructure, in particular the L<perf_event_open(2)> system
call.

It offers two modes of operation: I<process-monitoring mode> and
I<system-monitoring mode>.
In I<process-monitoring mode>, B<lo2s> will record information about a single
process and its descendants.
If I<COMMAND> is given, B<lo2s> acts as a prefix command, launching I<COMMAND>
and monitoring it until it exits.
Passing B<--> before I<COMMAND> stops option parsing in B<lo2s>, allowing
options to be passed to the command.
In case you want to monitor a process which is already running, specify B<-p>
I<PID> instead, where I<PID> is the process identifier of interest.
Monitoring will last until I<PID> exits.

I<System-monitoring mode> is enabled by passing the option B<-a>.
In this mode, B<lo2s> will monitor processes on all available CPUs indefinitely.
Optionally, if either I<COMMAND> or I<PID> is given, system monitoring will stop
when their respective processes exit.

At any time, monitoring can be interrupted safely by sending I<SIGINT> to
B<lo2s>.

Note that in order to access certain features, your system must be configured to
grant additional permissions.
The central point of configuration for B<perf> events is the
F</proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid> file.
The value in this file, called I<paranoid level>, represents the level of access
granted to B<perf>-features: the lower the value, the more features are
available.
Use L<systctl(8)> to change the level if needed:

    # sysctl kernel.perf_event_paranoid=<level>

See L<perf_event_open(2)> for a more detailed description.
Options in B<OPTIONS> are annotated with the I<paranoid level> they require.

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 General Options

=over

=item B<--help>

Show a help message.

=item B<--version>

Print version information.

=item B<-q>, B<--quiet>

Suppress all output, except for error messages.

=item B<-v>, B<--verbose>

Verbose output.
If specified multiple times, increase verbosity for each occurrence.

=over 6

=item B<NOTE:>

this option takes precedence over B<-q>.

=back


=item B<-o>, B<--output-path> I<PATH> (default: C<lo2s_trace_{DATE}>)

Save the generated trace in a directory specified by I<PATH>.
The argument to this option supports a simple templating mechanism.
If it contains sequences in the form of C<{...}>, the sequence is substituted
before being interpreted as a filesystem path.

Substituted sequences are:

=over 4

=item B<{DATE}>

The current date in the L<strftime(3)> format of I<%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S>.

=item B<{HOSTNAME}>

The L<hostname(7)> of the current system.

=item B<{ENV=>I<VAR>B<}>

Substitute the contents of environment variable I<VAR>.

=back

For example, running

    $ lo2s -o /tmp/trace_{ENV=USER}_{HOSTNAME} -- ...

might save the resulting trace file in the directory
F</tmp/trace_hal3000_discovery-one>.

=over 6

=item B<NOTE:>

If B<--output-trace> is not specified but the environment variable
I<LO2S_OUTPUT_TRACE> is set and not empty, its contents will be used to
determine the trace path instead, including variable substitution.

=back

=item B<-p>, B<--pid> I<PID>

Attach to a running process with process ID I<PID> instead of launching
I<COMMAND>.

=item B<-m>, B<--mmap-pages> I<N> (default: C<16>)

Allocate I<N> pages for each internal buffer shared between B<lo2s> and the
kernel.
Higher values may reduce the amount of lost samples on high sampling
frequencies.
The maximum amount of mappable memory per system is configured by
F</proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_mlock_kb>.

=item B<-i>, B<--readout-interval> I<MSEC> (default: C<100>)

Wake up B<lo2s> every I<MSEC> milliseconds to read both metric event and
sampling event buffers.
Increasing this values reduces the perturbation of measurements introduced by
B<lo2s> waking up to read buffers, but increases the risk of losing samples
because of overflowing buffers.
Use in conjunction with B<--mmap-pages>, B<--count> and B<--metric-count> to
minimize B<lo2s>'s overhead for your measurements.

=item B<-k>, B<--clockid> I<CLOCKID>

Set the internal reference clock used as a source of timestamps.
See B<--list-clockids> for a list of supported arguments.

Beyond standard clocks lo2s also supports a special "pebs" clock, which will
give the same timestamps as "monotonic-raw", but is set up in a slightly different
way to support the large PEBS feature of newer (Skylake+) Intel processors

=item B<--list-clockids>

List the names of clocks that can be used as I<CLOCKID> argument.

=over 6

=item B<NOTE:>

Available clocks are determined heuristically at compile time.
Not all clocks may usable when running B<lo2s> on a system that is not the build
system.

=back

=item B<--list-events>

List available metric and sampling events.
Listed events can be used as I<EVENT>-arguments.

=item B<--list-tracepoints>

List available tracepoint events.
Listed events can be used as I<TRACEPOINT>-arguments.

=item B<--list-knobs>

List available L<x86_adapt.h(3)> CPU configuration items.
Use where I<KNOB> is required.

=back

=head2 Mode-selection options

=over

=item B<-a>, B<--all-cpus>

Start B<lo2s> in I<system-monitoring mode>.
Running B<lo2s> in this mode requires a I<paranoid level> of at most 0.

=item B<-A>, B<--all-cpus-sampling>

Shorthand option, equivalent to B<-a --instruction-sampling>.

=back

=head2 Sampling options

=over

=item B<-->[B<no->]B<instruction-sampling>

Enable or disable recording of instruction samples.

=item B<-e>, B<--event> I<EVENT> (default: C<instructions>)

Set instruction sampling interrupt source event.

=item B<-c>, B<--count> I<N> (default: C<11010113>)

Record an instruction sample each time I<N> instruction sampling interrupt
source events have occurred (as specified by B<--event>).
The default value is chosen to be a prime number to avoid aliasing effects on
repetetive instruction execution in tight loops.

=item B<-g>, B<--call-graph>

Record call stack of instruction samples.

=item B<-->[B<no->]B<disassemble>

Enable or disable augmentation of samples with disassembled instructions.
Enabled by default if supported.

=item B<-->[B<no->]B<kernel>

Enable or disable recording events happening in kernel space.
Enabled by default.
Reading events from kernel space requires a I<paranoid level> of at most 1.

=back

=head2 Metric options

=over

=item B<-E>, B<--metric-event> I<EVENT>

Record metrics for this perf event.
May be specified multiple times to record metrics for more than one event.

=item B<--standard-metrics>

Enable a set of default events for metric recording.

=item B<--metric-leader> I<EVENT>

The leading metric event that controls how often metric events are read from
shared buffers.

=item B<--metric-count> I<N>

Instruct B<lo2s> to read metrics from kernel buffers every time I<N> metric
leader events (see B<--metric-leader>) have occured.
Higher values reduce the overhead incurred by B<lo2s>, but may lead to the
kernel buffers overflowing, in which case B<lo2s> will miss some metric events.
Use in conjunction with B<-m> to increase internal buffer sizes to reduce
overhead and risk of missing events.

=item B<--metric-frequency> I<HZ>

Instruct B<lo2s> to read metrics with a frequency of approximately I<HZ> Hz,
i.e. 1 / I<HZ> times per second.

=over 6

=item B<NOTE:>

The quality of this approximation depends on kernel heuristics and the selected
leading metric event (see B<--metric-leader>).
Prefer specifying B<--metric-count> over this option.

=back

=back

=head2 B<x86_adapt> and B<x86_energy> options

=over

=item B<-x>, B<--x86-adapt-knob> I<KNOB>

Record the L<x86_adapt.h(3)> knob I<KNOB>.
See B<--list-knobs> for a list of available arguments.

I<KNOB> may be suffixed with C<#I<SUFFIX>> to indicate an B<OTF2> metric mode,
where I<SUFFIX> is one of the following:

=over

=item C<absolute_point> | C<point> | C<p>:

B<OTF2_METRIC_ABSOLUTE_POINT>

=item C<absolute_last> | C<last> | C<l>:

B<OTF2_METRIC_ABSOLUTE_LAST>

=item C<accumulated_start> | C<accumulated>:

B<OTF2_METRIC_ACCUMULATED_START>

=back

=item B<-X>

Record L<x86_energy.h(3)> values.

=head2 Arguments to options

=over

=item I<EVENT>

The name of a perf event.
Format is one of the following:

=over

=item C<I<name>>

A predefined event.

=item C<I<pmu>/I<event>/> or C<I<pmu>:I<event>>

A kernel PMU event.
Kernel PMU events can be found under
F</sys/bus/event_source/devices/I<E<lt>pmuE<gt>>/event/I<E<lt>eventE<gt>>>.

=item C<rI<NNNN>>

A raw event, where I<NNNN> is the hexadecimal identifier of the event.

=back

See B<--list-events> for a list of events available.

=item I<TRACEPOINT>

The name of a kernel tracepoint event.
Format is one of

=over

=item C<I<group>:I<name>> or C<I<group>/I<name>>

=back

Tracepoint events can be found under
F</sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/I<E<lt>groupE<gt>>/I<E<lt>nameE<gt>>>.
Use B<--list-tracepoints> to get a list of tracepoints events.

Using L<perf-probe(2)>, it is possible to define dynamic tracepoints for use
with B<lo2s>.
Consider the C-function

    void __attribute__((optimize("O0")))
    my_marker(int some_variable)
    {
        ...
    }

that is compiled into F<a.out>.
Running

    # perf probe -x ./a.out my_marker some_variable

will create a dynamic tracepoint for this function available for use with
B<lo2s>:

    $ lo2s -t probe_a:my_marker ...

=over 6

=item B<NOTE:>

Recording tracepoint events usually requires both read and execute permissions
on F</sys/kernel/debug>.

=back

=item I<CLOCKID>

The name of a system clock.
Use B<--list-clockids> to get a list of clocks.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=over

=item B<LO2S_OUTPUT_TRACE>

See B<--output-trace>.

=item B<LO2S_OUTPUT_LINK>

If the variable is set, the contents of this variable specify the path at which
a symbolic link to the generated trace directory will be created.
If the path does not exist, a new symbolic link to the latest trace will be
generated.
If it does exists, but is a symbolic link, point it to the latest trace
directory.
Otherwise, issue a warning.

Setting this variable might be useful should you find yourself repeatedly
switching between generating traces and analyzing them.
Instructing your preferred trace analysis software to open the trace from the
symlinked directory allows you to quickly view the latest version by simply
reloading it.

=item B<LO2S_METRIC_PLUGINS>

A comma separated list of metric plugins to load.

=item B<LO2S_METRIC_>I<PLUGIN> or B<LO2S_METRIC_>I<PLUGIN>B<_PLUGIN>

A comma separated list of metric events to record for the plugin I<PLUGIN>.

=back

=over 6

=item B<NOTE:>

In compatibility with L<scorep(1)>, all environment variables starting with
C<LO2S_METRIC_> may be prefixed with C<SCOREP> instead of C<LO2S>.
