# `lo2s` - Lightweight Node-Level Performance Monitoring

`lo2s` creates parallel OTF2 traces with a focus on both application and system view.
The traces can contain any of the following information:

 * From running threads
   * Calling context samples based on instruction overflows
   * The calling context samples are annotated with the disassembled assembler instruction string
   * The framepointer-based call-path for each calling context sample
   * Per-thread performance counter readings
   * Which thread was scheduled on which CPU at what time
 * From the system
   * Metrics from tracepoints (e.g. the selected C-state or P-state)
   * The node-level system tree (cpus (HW-threads), cores, packages)
   * CPU power measurements (x86_energy)
   * Microarchitecture specific metrics (x86_adapt, per package or per core)
   * Arbitrary metrics through plugins (Score-P compatible)

In general `lo2s` operates either in **process monitoring** or **system monitoring** mode.

With **process monitoring**, all information is grouped by each thread of a monitored process group - it shows you *on which CPU is each monitored thread running*.
`lo2s` either acts as a prefix command to run the process (and also tracks its children), or `lo2s` attaches to a running process.

In the **system monitoring** mode, information is grouped by logical CPU - it shows you *which thread was running on a given CPU*.
Metrics are also shown per CPU.

In both modes, system-level metrics (e.g. tracepoints), are always grouped by their respective system hardware component.

# Build Requirements

 * Linux<sup>1</sup>
 * [OTF2](http://www.vi-hps.org/projects/score-p/index.html) (>= 3.0)
 * libbfd
 * libiberty
 * CMake (>= 3.11)
 * A C++ Compiler with C++17 support and the std::filesystem library (GCC > 7, Clang > 5)

<sup>1</sup>: Use Linux >= 4.1 for best results. Older versions, even the ancient 2.6.32, will work, but with degraded time synchronization.

# Optional Build Dependencies

 * [x86_adapt](https://github.com/tud-zih-energy/x86_adapt) for mircorarchitecture specific metrics
 * [x86_energy](https://github.com/tud-zih-energy/x86_energy) for CPU power metrics
 * libradare for disassembled instruction strings
 * libsensors for sensor readings

# Runtime Requirements

 * `kernel.perf_event_paranoid` should be less than or equal to `1` for process monitoring mode and less than or equal to `0` in system monitoring mode. A value of `-1` will give the most features for non-root performance recording, at the cost of some security. Modify as follows:

   `sudo sysctl kernel.perf_event_paranoid=1`

 * Tracepoints and system-wide monitoring on kernels older than 4.3 requires access to debugfs.
 Grant permissions at your own discretion.

   `sudo mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug`


# Installation

 * It is recommended to create an empty build directory anywhere.
 * `cmake /path/to/lo2s`
 * Configure cmake as usual, e.g. with `ccmake .`
 * `make`
 * `make install`

# Usage

To monitor a given application in process monitoring execute

 * `lo2s -- ./a.out --app-args`

To monitor all activity on a system run

 * `lo2s -a` (stop the recording with ctrl+c)

## Usage with MPI

You can record simple traces from MPI programs, but `lo2s` does not record MPI communication.
To create fully-featured MPI-aware traces, use [Score-P](https://score-p.org/).

 * `lo2s mpirun ./a.out` Create one trace of mpirun, useful if mpirun is used locally on one node.
 * `mpirun lo2s ./a.out` Creates a separate trace for each process.

See `man lo2s` or `lo2s --help` for a full listing of options and usage.

# Quirks

The `perf_event_open` kernel infrastructure changed significantly over time.
Therefore, it is already hard to just keep track which kernel version introduced which new feature.
Combine that with the abundance of backports of particular features by different distributors, and you end with a mess of options.

In the effort to keep compatible with older kernels, several quirks have been added to `lo2s`:

1. The initial time synchronization between lo2s and the kernel-space perf is done with a hardware breakpoint. If your kernel doesn't support that, you can disable it using the CMake option `USE_HW_BREAKPOINT_COMPAT`.
2. The used clock source for the kernel-space time measurments can be changed, however if you kernel doesn't support that, you can disable it with the CMake option `USE_PERF_CLOCKID`.
3. If you get the following error message: `event 'ref-cycles' is not available as a metric leader!`, you can fallback to the bus-cycles metric as leader using `--metric-leader bus-cycles`.

# Working with traces

You can use [OTF2](https://www.vi-hps.org/projects/score-p/) or any of its tools.
Native interfaces are available for C and Python
